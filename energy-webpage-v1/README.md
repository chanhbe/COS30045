# COS30045 – Appliance Energy Consumption Website

## Description
This website was developed for Exercise 0.2 in COS30045 Data Visualisation.
It demonstrates basic use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub version control.

## GenAI Usage
ChatGPT was used to assist with generating initial HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.
All generated code was reviewed and modified to ensure understanding.

## Reflection
Using ChatGPT helped speed up development and suggested useful patterns.
However, manual changes were required to fully understand how JavaScript handles
page navigation and DOM manipulation.
