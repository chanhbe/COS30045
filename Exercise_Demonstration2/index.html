      <h1>Australian TV Energy Consumption</h1>
      <p>
        Televisions are one of the most commonly used household appliances in
        Australia. As screen sizes increase and new technologies emerge,
        understanding energy consumption has become increasingly important.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website explores the energy efficiency of televisions currently
        available on the Australian market using data published by the
        Australian Government.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing an energy-efficient TV can help households reduce electricity
        costs and minimise environmental impact over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        By analysing real-world product data, this project aims to highlight
        key patterns in TV screen size, screen technology and energy use that
        are relevant to everyday consumers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>About the Data</h2>
      <p>
        The data used in this project comes from the Australian Government
        Energy Rating database and includes information about registered TV
        models sold in Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key attributes include brand, screen size, screen technology, power
        consumption and energy star rating. The data was cleaned and processed
        using KNIME Analytics Platform before being visualised.
      </p>

    <div class="card highlight">
      <h2>Key Question</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Which television brands offer the greatest number of models in the
          Australian market?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This question provides insight into market availability and helps
        consumers understand which brands dominate the TV market.

      <h2>Television Energy Data Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This section presents insights derived from the Australian Government
        television energy rating dataset. The visualisations focus on common
        characteristics of TVs available in Australia and how these relate
        to energy consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        All charts shown below were generated after cleaning and processing
        the data using KNIME Analytics Platform.

    <div class="card">
      <h3>TV Models by Brand</h3>
      <p>
        This chart shows the number of different television models offered
        by each brand in the Australian market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brands with a larger number of models typically have a stronger
        market presence and provide consumers with a wider range of choices.
      </p>

        alt="Number of TV models by brand"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        The chart indicates that a small number of major brands dominate the
        market in terms of model variety, while many other brands offer only
        a limited selection of TVs.
      </p>

      <h3>Popular Screen Sizes</h3>
      <p>
        Screen size is an important factor for consumers, as it affects both
        viewing experience and energy consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart below displays the frequency of different screen size
        categories available in Australia.
      </p>

      <img
        src="images/screen_size.png"
        alt="Popularity of TV screen sizes"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        The data shows that 70+ inch and 60-69 inch televisions are the most
        commonly available sizes, suggesting a balance between screen size,
        cost and energy efficiency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Screen Technology Availability</h3>
      <p>
        Television screen technology has a significant impact on both picture
        quality and power consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chart compares the availability of different screen technologies
        currently sold in Australia.
      </p>

        src="images/screen_tech.png"
        alt="TV screen technology distribution"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        LCD-based technologies dominate the market, while OLED TVs are
        becoming increasingly popular. Plasma TVs appear very rarely,
        indicating that this technology is largely outdated.
