      <h2>Decoding the Australian Television Market</h2>
      <p>
        The Australian television market is more than just a collection of products; 
      it is a reflection of evolving technology and changing consumer lifestyles. 
      To understand the impact of these devices, we must first look at the 
      <strong>composition of the market itself</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section dives into the data-driven trends of 
      <strong>technology adoption, screen size preferences, and brand competition</strong>. 
      By analyzing these three pillars, we can see how the industry is moving 
      and what options are truly available to the Australian public today.

    <!-- QUESTION 1 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Question 1: What Screen Technologies Dominate the Market?</h3>

      <p>
        Screen technology determines how efficiently a television converts
        electricity into light. As a result, different display technologies
        can have noticeably different energy consumption profiles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding which technologies dominate the Australian market helps
        explain why certain energy consumption patterns are more prevalent
        than others.
      </p>

        alt="Distribution of TV screen technologies"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        The visualisation shows that LCD-based technologies overwhelmingly
        dominate the Australian television market. OLED televisions, while still
        representing a smaller share, are increasingly available, reflecting
        growing consumer interest in premium image quality. Plasma televisions
        appear only rarely, suggesting that this technology has effectively
        disappeared from modern retail offerings.
      </p>

      <div class="feature-box">
        <h4><i class="icon">✨</i> Why OLED is the Premium Choice</h4>
        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <strong>Perfect Blacks:</strong> Unlike LCDs, OLED pixels emit their own light and can turn off completely, creating infinite contrast.
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <strong>Ultra-Thin Design:</strong> Without the need for a bulky backlight unit, OLED TVs can be as thin as a few millimeters.
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <strong>Superior Response:</strong> Perfect for gaming and sports due to near-instantaneous pixel response times.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="so-what">
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Because LCD televisions dominate the
        market, even modest improvements in LCD energy efficiency could lead to
        significant national energy savings. Conversely, as OLED adoption grows,
        its higher average power usage may become more relevant in future
        energy planning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- QUESTION 2 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Question 2: Which Screen Sizes Are Most Common?</h3>

      <p>
        Screen size is one of the most visible factors influencing television
        purchases. Larger screens generally require more power, particularly
        during extended viewing sessions in the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Analysing screen size distribution provides insight into consumer
        preferences and their potential impact on household electricity demand.
      </p>

        src="images/screen_size.png"
        alt="Popularity of TV screen sizes in Australia"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        The data indicates that large televisions, especially those above
        60 inches, are widely available across the Australian market. Smaller
        televisions are comparatively less common, suggesting a strong consumer
        preference for immersive, cinema-like viewing experiences.
      </p>

      <div class="feature-box">
        <h4><i class="icon">📏</i> Finding Your Perfect Fit: Size Advantages</h4>
        <div class="size-specs">
          <div class="size-tag gold">
            <strong>70+ Inch:</strong> The Ultimate Home Cinema. Best for dedicated media rooms and large open-plan living areas.
          </div>
          <div class="size-tag bronze">
            <strong>60-69 Inch:</strong> The Modern Standard. Offers high immersion for 4K movies while fitting comfortably in most living rooms.
          </div>
          <div class="size-tag light">
            <strong>50-59 Inch:</strong> The Versatile Performer. Perfect balance of price and size for standard bedrooms or smaller apartments.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="so-what">
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> At scale, widespread adoption of large
        televisions can contribute to increased residential electricity demand,
        particularly during peak evening hours. Even small increases in average
        screen size can result in substantial cumulative energy consumption.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- QUESTION 3 -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Question 3: Which Brands Offer the Most Television Models?</h3>

      <p>
        Brand dominance plays an important role in shaping consumer choice.
        Brands that offer a wide range of models are more likely to influence
        purchasing decisions across different budgets, screen sizes, and
        energy ratings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This analysis focuses on the number of television models offered by
        each brand, revealing the structure of the Australian television market.
      </p>

      <img
        src="images/tv_models_by_brand.png"
        alt="Number of TV models by brand"
        class="chart"
      />

      <p class="insight">
        The chart shows that a small number of major brands dominate the market
        by offering a large variety of television models. In contrast, many other
        brands provide only a limited selection, resulting in a market that is
        both competitive and highly concentrated.
      </p>

      <div class="feature-box">
      <h4><i class="icon">🏆</i> Market Leader Strategies: Why it matters</h4>
      <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <strong>The Tech Giants (Samsung, LG):</strong> 
          With over 600-1100 models, these brands invest heavily in R&D to offer a TV for every possible niche, from entry-level to luxury 8K.
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <strong>The Value Disruptors (Kogan, Hisense):</strong> 
          Focus on "price-to-performance." They offer high model variety to dominate the mid-range market with competitive pricing.
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <strong>The Niche Players:</strong> 
          Brands with fewer models often focus on specific segments, such as ultra-budget options or specialized high-end cinematic displays.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <p class="so-what">
        <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Because a small number of brands account
        for a large proportion of available models, their design decisions and
        energy efficiency standards can have a disproportionate impact on overall
        television energy consumption in Australia.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- TAKEAWAY -->
    <div class="card takeaway">
      <h3>Overall Insight</h3>
      <p>
        Together, these visualisations reveal a television market characterised
        by large screen sizes, widespread use of LCD-based technologies, and
        dominance by a small number of major brands.
      </p>
      <p>
        While individual purchasing decisions may seem minor, their combined
        effect shapes national energy demand. By understanding these broader
        patterns, consumers can make more informed choices that balance viewing
        experience, cost, and long-term energy consumption.
